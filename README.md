# debian-jessie-zfs-root
Installs Debian GNU/Linux 8 Jessie to a native ZFS root filesystem using a [Debian Jessie Live CD](https://www.debian.org/CD/live/) and ZFS packages from [backports.org](https://backports.debian.org/).

If you like this project, you may also want to try to [install a Debian Stretch ZFS root system](https://github.com/hn/debian-stretch-zfs-root).

## Usage

1. Boot [Jessie Live CD](https://www.debian.org/CD/live/) ('standard' edition)
1. Login (user: `user`, password: `live`) and become root
1. Setup network and export `http_proxy` environment variable (if needed)
1. Run this script
1. User interface: Select disks and RAID level
1. Let the installer do the work
1. User interface: install grub to *all* disks participating in the array
1. User interface: enter root password and select timezone
1. Reboot

## Fixes included

* grub (v2.02, included in Debian 8), especially `grub-probe`, [does not support](https://github.com/zfsonlinux/grub/issues/19) [all ZFS features](http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?42861) and subsequently [refuses to install](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub2/+bug/1451476). This script disables `feature@hole_birth` and `feature@embedded_data` (and you _must_ _not_ enable those features after installation).
* The ZFS SPL uses the system `hostid`, [which isn't initialized correctly on Debian systems](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=595790).
* Workaround for grub (v2.02) [mysteriously _not_ searching devices in `/dev/disk/by-id` but in `/dev`](https://github.com/zfsonlinux/grub/issues/5).
* Some mountpoints, notably `/var`, need to be mounted via fstab as the ZFS mount script runs too late during boot.
* The EFI System Partition (ESP) is a single point of failure on one disk, [this is arguably a mis-design in the UEFI specification](https://wiki.debian.org/UEFI#RAID_for_the_EFI_System_Partition).

## Bugs

* Booting via EFI has not been tested at all.
* ~~RAID10 Mirror with >= 6 disks fails to boot with grub, probably a grub bug.~~ The (Virtualbox) BIOS does not detect more than 4 drives connected to a virtual SATA controller and therefore grub isn't able to access them. Operating the drives in a SCSI or mixed SATA/IDE/SCSI RAID10 configuration works fine, even with 6 or more drives.
